## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is an update to an existing release. The changes are reported in NEWS.md and on GitHub.

* The pre-print of the accompanying peer-reviewed journal article is located at Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry with doi:10.22541/au.167852562.21460824/v1. This is not the final article.

* I have tested my code on R for Windows 10, Mac OS 11.6, Fedora Linux and Ubuntu Linux.


* I have reduced the example data size and now each example takes less than five seconds to run.
I've kept the documentation and additional examples suggesting to set the argument profile = FALSE for the endPoint function to run faster.
To have two examples that show the profile = TRUE adds value as a visualisation of the function.

* The spellings of foraminifera and spectrometry are as expected.

* There were no errors or warnings.
