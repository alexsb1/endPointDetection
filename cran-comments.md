## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

* I have reduced the example data size and now each example takes less than five seconds to run.
I've kept the documentation and additional examples suggesting to set the argument profile = FALSE for the endPoint function to run faster.
To have two examples that show the profile = TRUE adds value as a visualisation of the function.

* I have tested my code on R for Windows 10, Mac OS 11.6, Fedora Linux and Ubuntu Linux.

* The spellings of foraminifera and spectrometry are as expected.

* This package will accompany a journal article, currently in preparation and without a DOI.

* There were no errors or warnings.
