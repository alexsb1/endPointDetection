## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
The note is about the time taken to run the first example given, at six seconds on remote machines during the checking process.
It is likely that the time taken to run the example is less on a typical user's machine.
The documentation and additional examples also suggest to set the argument profile = FALSE for the endPoint function to run faster.
To have two examples that show the profile = TRUE adds value as a visualisation of the function.

I have tested my code on R for Windows 10, Mac OS 11.6, Fedora Linux and Ubuntu Linux.

The spellings of foraminifera and spectrometry are as expected.

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
